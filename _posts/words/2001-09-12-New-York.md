```â€”words of a survivor```

> will the hand endure moving over this paper  
will any poem have enough weight  
to leave a line of flight above the desolate landscape  
ever enough face to lift against death's dark silence  
who will tell today  
>  
> the huge anthill of people remains quiet  
somber and bright but obscure  
as if the brown effluvium of sputtering towers  
sweeps still the skyline with a filthy flag  
who will weep today  
>  
> today images wail for voice behind the eyes  
planes as bombs stuffed with shrapnel of soft bodies  
then the fire inferno flame-flowers from skyscrapers  
human flares like falling angels from the highest floor  
down, down all along shimmering buildings of glass and steel  
fluted in abandoned beauty and fluttering  
weightless and willowy and flame-winged to streamline  
fleeting reflections in the fugitive language of forgetting  
the hellhound of destruction has a red tongue of laughter  
>  
> who will tell and who will count  
gouged eyes do not understand the blue of sky  
through a dismal and chilly nuclear winter  
people stumble people shuffle  
stumble-people shuffle-people worm-white-people  
>  
> where lie the faces  
old before their end or their wedding  
grayed in ashes from head to toe  
as if clothed in coats of the snowing knowing of ages  
>  
> beneath rummage and debris rosy corpses move and mumble  
and in East River confidential files and folders float  
with shreds and feathers lacerated human meat  
scorched confetti for the dog's feast  
who will tell tomorrow tomorrow  
>  
> where are the faces  
will the tongue still think  
still pulse its dark lair  
with flamed memory of bliss  
will words still drink oblivion  
will any poem some day ever carry sufficient weight  
to leave the script of scraps recalling fall and forgetting  
>  
> will death remain quivering in the paper
