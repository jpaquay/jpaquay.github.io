## Estuary

> Plunging, we tasted salt  
 sharper than a dream  
 and, breathless,  
 still on the tongue,  
 brine skin. You head first.  
 I climbed down, cold  
 like heat, into numb.  
 We remembered how to touch,  
 invented strokes we never  
 practiced—more prickly  
 on your tongue  
 my shivering skin.  
 Gasping air like breathing in  
 the night, till we floated  
 shoulders, arms, hands, feet:  
 into one forbidden city  
 we sank  
 and bribed the guards.  
 Did we go home—  
 did we ever swim—  
 frozen in summer ice?
