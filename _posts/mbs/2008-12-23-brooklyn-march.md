### Brooklyn March

> Wilted balloons caught in trees inflate.  
Bare branches web the sky like safety  
nets for birds. Cars spill murky water  
from pools that swallow nothing back.  
They say another city hums beneath  
the streets. I can’t read an urban legend  
on my phone, the sun’s so bright.  
Booted to the knee, a woman steps out  
and jaywalks the grid, swinging her hips,  
making busy taxis idle. Drivers baby  
potholes; letter carriers smile.  
Spring heats the skin. Dazzled by the sheen  
off the street, I drop my jacket in a heap.  
Balloons and pedestrians float higher.
