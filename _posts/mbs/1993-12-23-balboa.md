## #31 Balboa

> I roll with the bus.  
This west-bound  
route amazes me,  
a street where no one  
peeks out tight-  
shuttered eyes.  
> 
> Headed far as a trip  
goes, passengers jerk  
along. No one pulls  
the cord or waits by  
the curb. In the outer  
district, tides tug  
the streets. Blocks  
stretch long.  
> 
> Delirious, I slide past  
pastel faces, wishing  
the ride would not  
end, even here, where  
armored plates collide.  
> 
> “Ocean Beach,” flashes  
red, end of the line,  
the Pacific splashed  
on the windshield
> 
> and a blaze of sand.  
> 
> Ripping blinders from  
both sides, I see  
an endless horizontal  
line, azure above,  
below, scalloped green.  
> 
> What I know falls away—  
wild surmise.
