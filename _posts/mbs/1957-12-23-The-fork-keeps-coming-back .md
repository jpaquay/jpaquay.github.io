### The fork keeps coming back 

> Chopsticks at the next table remind me  
that, in time, implements we employ fit  
the hand that uses, a knack that turns  
to a comfort when practiced over years.  
In my family, like many, it's a simple fork,  
too ordinary to notice clutched in a palm.  
> 
> Eating with my Oma, I held it in one palm  
though shifting left to right came easier to me,  
the way most Americans wield a fork.  
In high school, policing habits in a fit  
of imitation, I ended the lefty way for years.  
Amazing how aspects I display take turns,  
even those plain as my nose: fat lips turn  
to gobble a man's kisses. His broad palm  
passes and magically waves away years  
of averting my eyes from mirrors, giving me  
an unfractured oval when I see that I fit  
one woman's brand of beauty (as others fork  
out sums to look ethnic.) I belong, like a fork  
beside a knife. And my father, as he turns  
himself American, learning fresh slang to fit  
speech patterns his mother did not get. A palm  
hid a pack of Chesterfields, his mind, me,  
after studies and a love found in Germanyâ€”years.  
> 
> I was copper-haired and brash in girl years  
of dirty nails, rowdy manners; my fork  
craft did not please my dad, though it gave me  
nourishment enough. When she shuts up and turns  
to a boy for approval, he's got her in his palm,  
and no pose a girl assumes is likely to befit  
her style. What style? All I wanted was to fit  
in, distinctiveness the terror of those years  
of high school. My hoop-star boyfriend could palm  
the ball. Dwarfing me, he said, about the fork  
trick, "Don't ever do it in my house." It turns  
up in Brussels where he tries to copy it from me.  
> 
> Not a willing misfit, flirting or employing a fork,  
I watched myself for years. The impulse returns  
as chopsticks hit my palm. Now it's all up to me.
