## Author’s Statement on Beauty

What a coincidence to be asked to say something about beauty a couple of days after being warned by my colleagues to strike the word from a poem, the very friends who suggested I submit work to Peacock Journal! Following their lead, I won’t attempt to define. Where verse is concerned, music is key. What a poet hears, the vernacular of the street or any other, is crafted with echoing sounds, stresses, pauses, strange words and familiar, which create an opportunity for expectation satisfied and surprise—the delight of language.
