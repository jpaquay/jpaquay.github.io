### Saint Of Souvenirs

> A traveler pockets smallest pieces.  
Beach glass rhymes in shades of amber,  
morning sky or beer-green, all grayed,  
tumbled in time. It grates her, too.  
>
> By design, she cannot tell them, one  
from where the other came, sea-salt  
effluvia that curls up some Atlantic  
beach, whichever side. Channels run  
>
> in and away, sea smoothing memory.  
Fingering each bit to guard against  
sharp, she learns by Braille the rub  
of years and interprets shards  
>
> cut off from thirst. She jumbles them  
like her old toys, turvy or side by  
side, then drops each into a reliquaryâ€”  
jewels saved by drowning.
