## And why is the World

> so many,  
and my decor so single? Bugs, chairs,  
or feathers, garbage cans, motes alive  
in bright air, multi-hued catalogues  
for Christmas. Serials served in sit-com  
or bowl, one "I do" after another,  
and me, alone, in an attic at home,  
two children aloft in plane, ship or tree  
who don't hang, anymore, on my say.

> Not even Suleiman the Magnificent of me,  
I have one deviceâ€”bind a band  
round my head to create the illusion and  
conjure the furniture of my ultimate sway.
